I am currently completing my MSc in Computer Science at Saarland University, conducting research at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. My work focuses on generative vision, controlled video and image synthesis, and multimodal learning. I am particularly interested in developing advanced AI systems that can generate realistic visual content while ensuring identity preservation and controllability across multiple modalities.
